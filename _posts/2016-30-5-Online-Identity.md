title: Online Identity for Coders.
---
It is important for all coders to know:

1.  Accept that you have an online identity, that you exist online and that people can find information about you.

2. Realise that having an online identity can be good, and will influence how people perceive you.

3. Decide that you need to professionalize your online identity and you can do this even when you haven't created profiles.

4. Acknowledge that you will not be able to keep two separate online identities for personal and professional purposes.

5. Find what's out there, clean it up and correct the mess.

6. Think carefully about personal branding because that's what you're doing when you create and manage your online identity.

7. Create your online portfolio.

8. Create profiles to make it easier to find your portfolio.

9. Be mindful of your online existence and treat it with respect.

10. Share your portfolio, use it and keep it current.
