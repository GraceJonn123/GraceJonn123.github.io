###What are some of the steps to design thinking, you may wonder. Well lucky you i know a tit bit about some of those steps.

1. Empathize 
  - Listen to the user and try to understand their point of view.
2. Define 
  - Based on what you understood, derive a point of view based on you, the designer.
3. Research 
  - Find out more about the definition.
4. Ideate 
  - Start thinking of ideas that you could implement. In short, brainstorming.
5. Prototype 
  - Create an actual model of how the product will look like.
6. Test 
  - Get user feedback on what to add to prototype or what to remove.
7. Repeat 
  - Iteration is key, as much as needed to bring user satisfaction.
